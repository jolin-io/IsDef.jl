## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0]
### Changed
- renamed ``IsDef._return_type`` to ``IsDef.return_type`` for analogy with `Core.Compiler.return_type`
- `Function` is now dealt like `Any` in the sense that no attempt is made to break it down into subtypes

### Fixed
- `isdef`/`Ã’ut`/`return_type` now work correctly on `Type{...}` constructs. There was an unexpected behaviour with InteractiveUtils.subtypes which is now worked around.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-03-06
